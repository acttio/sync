# Introduction

This is the SYNC official repository.

SYNC is Java lightweight Application Server + Framework built to improve code delivery for classic MVC
It has been built to perform with zero reflection latency during runtime while improving developers
productivity for zero dependency; by using pure POJO classes.

## History

This project I developed back in 2012 and kept using it for many years on our own personal projects.
REST & Microservices became popular but for small projects maybe MVC still has some fit.
If you're interested to see it working... check the code! ;-)
